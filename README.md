Exploring the concept of literacy as it relates to real-world educational settings
Introductory comments:The aim of this document is to provide you with some guidance on how to write the summative essay for the LLC module. However, please, consider the following as guidance, and not as a prescriptive template. You are able and allowed to work through the requirements differently.
There are 3 elements you need to connect in the essay:1.   A concept from the module that relates to literacy: The concepts from the modules are listed on the moodle space, but you will find you have a broad choice:Literacy and literacy practices, Role of literacy in forming identity,Relationship between language and literacy, Literacy and learning, The link between literacy and citizenship, Literacy and politics of language, Literacy and power of language.2.   Real-world educational setting:   The definition of an educational setting is equally broad – a place and space where people learn. We may think of locations like schools or museums, but we can also think of learning at home in families, where babies learn to walk and talk, or learning online. The educational setting you choose will therefore link to your understanding of what constitutes learning and how we learn.3.   Educational resource:   The educational resource can be anything such as a textbook, a website, a worksheet, a social media platform. or an app.    The key will be to explain how your chosen resource is an educational resource that relates to literacy and how it is used in your chosen educational setting.
The best starting point is probably to identify what aspect of literacy is of interest to you and which educational resource you can draw on and then consider what educational setting this source can be used in.
